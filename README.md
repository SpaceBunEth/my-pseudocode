# my-pseudocode
Project Description: create an in-depth pseudocode file documenting a real-world process that you are familiar with.  Think of the process as if you are explaining to someone how you do something. Remember, you are not writing code.   Pseudocode should be human-readable detailed instructions for anyone to be able to follow.
